# ifBuildingsCouldTalk

This project started out as an idea for the 2016 [Hack-a-LOD](http://hackalod.com/index.php/verslag/).

Meanwhile it has grown to a development project, where we try to link all kinds of historical datasets and archival qualitative sources,
to describe the people that lived in historical buildings
